# Card Design Project

Welcome to my **Card Design Project**! This project showcases a visually appealing and responsive card design created using **HTML** and **CSS**. It was one of my early projects while learning web development, and it demonstrates the use of gradients, shadows, and flexbox to create a modern and interactive user interface.

## Features

- **Beautiful Gradients**: The card uses gradient backgrounds to create a visually stunning effect.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and shadows enhance user interaction.
- **Clean Code**: The project is structured with clean and well-commented HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including gradients, shadows, and animations.
- **Flexbox**: For creating a flexible and responsive layout.
